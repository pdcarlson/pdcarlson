          <p className="project-description">
            This project involved a complete overhaul of a legacy web map system used by 9 different towns. I re-architected the front-end, migrating the code to a clean, centralized GitHub repository to make updates instant and consistent. Beyond this modernization, I developed a suite of professional-grade features to transform the tool for power users. Key additions include a dynamic legend that only shows visible map items, a robust bookmarking system, and an advanced, multi-page printing utility. This print feature allows users to generate custom reports with specific layer combinations and save their company information, a core component designed for future monetization.

            The Munsell Color Mapper is a mobile app I'm developing to replace the expensive, cumbersome process of manually identifying soil color in the field. I am building a Python-based backend with custom algorithms that can analyze a photo of a soil sample and instantly find the closest Munsell color match. The final app, deployed on iOS using Swift, is being built to work offline and will eventually include a cloud database to log sample locations and images.

          <p className="project-description">
            In response to the HackRPI "Urban Upgrades" challenge, my teammate and I developed a Python tool to analyze ideal placement for new EV charging stations. The goal was to find a data-driven way to maximize the impact of new infrastructure investments. Our solution processed datasets on population density and existing charger locations to produce an interactive map, providing a foundational proof-of-concept for strategic urban planning.
