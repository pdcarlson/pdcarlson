### 🚀 My Projects

#### 🗺️ ESE Map Viewer
I overhauled a complex web map for nine different towns, making it faster, more powerful, and easier to update. I rebuilt the user interface and introduced key features like a dynamic legend, a robust bookmarking system, and a tool for generating custom PDF reports, laying the groundwork for a future subscription service. The viewer handles over 100GB of content hosted in the cloud, loaded dynamically as a self-implemented tileset to display USGS map layers.
